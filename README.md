# Command line tool for malware detection using machine learning approach
Virus detection is a fundamental classification problem i.e. we can train a program to recognize whether a piece of software is a malware or not and thus we can we can detect and delete it. We build an antivirus script in Python by training a classifier to be able to detect Portable Executable (PE) format files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) as either malicious or non-malicious. This classifier problem works on 5 different classification algorithms and chooses the best one for prediction by comparing their results.
